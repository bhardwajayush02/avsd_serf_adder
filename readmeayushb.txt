⦁Project Title - Low power and High speed 1 bit full adder circuit

⦁Project Description:- 

This is a circuit design simulation project which is developed using the open source EDA tool eSim and skywater 130nm technology. 
The circuit developed is SERF which stands for Static Energy Recovery Full Adder which used ten CMOS transistor with 4T XOR logics to achieve low power and fast speed.
The design technique takes three inputs and produces two sum and carry outputs.

⦁Motivation Behind the Project:-

The motivation behind this project is to learn the design circuit simulator tool and how to connect to skywater 130 nm technology. 
 My goal is  to pursue a career in VLSI design so it motivates me to build this project using the real technology to learn about the different concepts of CMOS technology 
 and how to proceed further with skywater 130nm technology which is a  mature 180nm-130nm hybrid technology which helps in creating a PDK files in semiconductor industry 
 to model a fabrication process for design tools used to design an integrated circuit. 

⦁Technology used - eSim, Skywater 130 nm

⦁Tasks done during this Hackathon:-  
                              i) Completed the courses provided on udemy to have a basic understanding   
                                     about CMOS Technology and eSim.

                             ii)  Going through various research papers to select the circuit for design and           
                                    submitted the literature survey on the proposed selected circuit.

                             iii)  The proposed selected circuit is being designed using the eSim and 
                                  simulated through skywater 130 nm technology to obtain the waveforms.

                             iv)  The designed new circuit final report is submitted with the netlist files and    
                                    waveform files.

⦁ Debugging Steps in Project

                               i)  First of all circuit has been designed in eSim using Schematic.

                               ii) Then after designing the circuit , put ports and change the name of  
                                    components and name the ports.

                              iii) Then perform electrical rules to find any error in the circuit.

                              iv) If error occured, then place power flag in the error place .

                              v) Then again run the electrical rules by saving the schematic.


                             vi)  Then create a netlist in order to generate .cir file.

                            vii) Download the skywater pdk libraries and place the .cir and files in same 
                                 folder.

                           viii) Then change the components of .cir files according to the models defined 
                                in the libraries of skywater.

                            ix) Then run the .cir files in ngspice and the desired waveform will generated.
                   


⦁ Challenges faced :- 

There were some challenges faced during the hackathon. Thebig challenge was to implement the circuit design using esim to connect with the   
skywater 130 nm technology as we have to replace the design circuit components with the models defined in the skywater and there was some problem occur 
while encoding the components but thanks to the mentor assigned to us during hackathon who clears my doubt and help me to clarify my problems.
